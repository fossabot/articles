### Abstract


Effective coders recognise tedious repetition and transform it into reusable patterns.  Frameworks, libraries and design patterns arise
from it.

The GoF patterns were all about Object Orientation, but today we are also looking at the functional programming world.  One of the patters _they_ bumped into is the Monoid: it has its application in addition, accumulation, concatenation, you name it.

And it's a simple one.

This talk is about how Monoids seem to be everywhere, and how recognising them has influenced my daily practice.  It will show a glimpse of the land of functional design patterns and look at practical aspects of using Monoids in C++.

I believe it's important.  And I believe there's a lot more to be discovered.
