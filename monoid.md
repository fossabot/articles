# Abstract

<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em;"> -->  

We love coding: automating the dull and parameterizing it.  The result makes our users happy.

We too become more effective coders ourselves, once we start recognising that we apply
the same patterns again and again!  So we automate _that_ and parameterize it!  This is often called
metaprogramming, and frameworks, libraries and design patterns are born from it.

These modern days, we are pollinated by the functional programming world.  One of those
they discovered in the previous century is the Monoid: addition, accumulation, reduction, you name it.

This talk is about how Monoids seem to be everywhere, and how recognising them has influenced the
amount of reuse in my daily practice.  It will show a glimpse of the land of functional design patterns.

I believe it's important.  And I believe there's a lot more.
